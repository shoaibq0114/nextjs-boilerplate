            <p className="text-gray-300">
              Welcome to Hackersdemy! I&apos;m Mohammed Shoaib, a cybersecurity professional and educator with over 7 years of experience in this dynamic and ever-growing field. Cybersecurity has been my passion for years, and I&apos;ve made it my mission to share what I&apos;ve learned through hands-on experience with students from all walks of life.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-300">
              I hold certifications such as Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), Splunk Cybersecurity Defense Analyst (SPLK-5001), and eWPT (eLearnSecurity Web Application Penetration Tester), among others. Over the course of my career, I&apos;ve trained more than 4,000 students—both online and offline—from India and 12+ countries, including the United States, Canada, Iran, Australia, and Bangladesh.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-300">
              My teaching journey began at renowned institutes like Entersoft Labs and Durgasoft Solutions in Hyderabad, as well as Apponix Technologies in Bengaluru. However, after COVID-19, I decided to pursue my vision of creating my own institute. I founded Zeroday Hackers, which later evolved into Hackersdemy—a name that emphasizes our dedication to simplifying and teaching cybersecurity concepts with a focus on practical application.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-300">
              Currently, I work as a Senior Security Analyst at Symbiosys Technologies in Visakhapatnam, actively engaging in the same domain I teach. This allows me to provide students with real-time insights into the tools, techniques, and methodologies used in today&apos;s cybersecurity landscape. I believe in teaching what I&apos;ve learned over the years from my own practical experience in the industry, ensuring that students gain not just theoretical knowledge but a deep understanding of how to apply it in real-world scenarios.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-300">
              At Hackersdemy, I focus on breaking down complex cybersecurity topics into simple, relatable concepts. My teaching includes real-time examples and hands-on training with industry-relevant tools, so students are not only well-prepared but confident in their skills. Whether it&apos;s ethical hacking, SOC analysis, penetration testing, or cyber forensics, I ensure my students have a solid foundation to build successful careers in cybersecurity.
