              In today&apos;s digital era, web applications are integral to business operations, facilitating services from online banking 
              to e-commerce. However, this reliance has made them prime targets for cyberattacks. In 2024 alone, there was a 20% increase 
              in exploited security vulnerabilities compared to the previous year. As web applications continue to be prime targets for cybercriminals, 
              understanding how to secure them is more important than ever. The global penetration testing market is projected to exceed $5 billion annually by 2031.

                At Hackersdemy, we understand that flexibility is important. That&apos;s why we offer the first three 
                classes as free demo sessions, allowing you to experience the course before making any commitment. 
                After the demo, payment can be made, and if you feel the course isn&apos;t the right fit, <span className="font-bold">you can request 
                a cancellation or refund within the first 7 classes, including the demo sessions.</span> We want to ensure 
                you&apos;re completely satisfied with your learning experience, and we&apos;re here to help you make the best 
                decision. However, after the first 7 classes, candidates are not eligible for a refund or cancellation.
